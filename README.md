# Thinc
ECMAScript Thin Client based on nw.js and Web Components

## Why?

We need simple web thin client app with tabs support.

## How?

Simply by using [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) and Web Components with [Polymer](http://polymer-project.org)

## Where to start?

* `$ git clone https://github.com/angie-party/Thinc.git`
* `$ cd Thinc`
* `$ npm install`
* `$ npm start`

This will open client window with example page, or you can see how tabs are working here http://angie-party.github.io/Thinc/ remember you have to use **Google Chrome**.

If you want to develop run `$ npm run develop` and open http://0.0.0.0:8080 in Google Chrome.
